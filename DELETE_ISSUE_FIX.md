# DPR Delete Issue - Diagnosis & Fix

## Problem Report
**Page**: `http://localhost/dpr/c_dpr/dpr`  
**Issue**: Users unable to delete DPR records  
**Symptoms**: 
- Alert confirmation shows
- Page refreshes
- **Data NOT deleted** (silently fails)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Symptoms Analysis
Based on 5-7 possible sources, narrowed down to the most likely cause:

**PRIMARY CAUSE: Missing Cutting Tools Usage Deletion**

The delete function in `c_new.php` was deleting from 3 tables:
1. ✅ `t_production_op` (main table)
2. ✅ `t_production_op_release` (release details)
3. ✅ `t_production_op_dl` (defect/losstime details)

But it was **NOT** deleting from:
4. ❌ `t_production_op_cutting_tools_usage` (cutting tools usage)

When a DPR record has associated cutting tools, the database foreign key constraint prevents deletion of the parent record, causing the operation to **silently fail** with no error message to the user.

### Secondary Issues Found
1. **No error handling** - Delete function had no try-catch or error feedback
2. **No user feedback** - No success/error messages displayed
3. **No logging** - CodeIgniter logging was disabled (threshold = 0)

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Delete Function (`application/controllers/c_new.php`)

**Before** (lines 632-639):
```php
function del_production_reporting_op($id_production)
{
  $this->mm->delete_production_op($id_production);
  $this->mm->delete_production_detail($id_production);
  $this->mm->delete_production_op_release($id_production);
  $this->session->set_flashdata('success', 'Data berhasil dihapus!');
  redirect('c_dpr/dpr');
}
```

**After** (with validation & proper deletion order):
```php
function del_production_reporting_op($id_production)
{
  // Add logging to diagnose the issue
  log_message('debug', 'Attempting to delete production: ' . $id_production);
  
  // Check if cutting tools usage exists
  $cutting_tools_check = $this->db->get_where('t_production_op_cutting_tools_usage', 
    array('id_production' => $id_production))->num_rows();
  log_message('debug', 'Cutting tools usage records found: ' . $cutting_tools_check);
  
  try {
    // Delete in correct order (child records first)
    
    // 1. Delete cutting tools usage (if exists) - THE FIX!
    if ($cutting_tools_check > 0) {
      $this->db->where('id_production', $id_production);
      $this->db->delete('t_production_op_cutting_tools_usage');
      log_message('debug', 'Deleted cutting tools usage');
    }
    
    // 2. Delete production details
    $this->mm->delete_production_detail($id_production);
    log_message('debug', 'Deleted production details');
    
    // 3. Delete production op release
    $this->mm->delete_production_op_release($id_production);
    log_message('debug', 'Deleted production op release');
    
    // 4. Delete main production record
    $this->mm->delete_production_op($id_production);
    log_message('debug', 'Deleted production op - SUCCESS');
    
    $this->session->set_flashdata('success', 'Data berhasil dihapus!');
  } catch (Exception $e) {
    log_message('error', 'Delete failed: ' . $e->getMessage());
    $this->session->set_flashdata('error', 'Gagal menghapus data: ' . $e->getMessage());
  }
  
  redirect('c_dpr/dpr');
}
```

**Key Changes**:
- ✅ Added deletion of `t_production_op_cutting_tools_usage` **FIRST** (child records before parent)
- ✅ Added try-catch error handling
- ✅ Added debug logging at each step
- ✅ Added error message feedback
- ✅ Proper deletion order (foreign key compliance)

---

### 2. Added User Feedback (`application/views/dpr/dpr.php`)

Added success/error message display at line 61-78:

```php
<!-- Success/Error Messages -->
<?php if ($this->session->flashdata('success')): ?>
    <div class="alert alert-success alert-dismissible fade show" role="alert">
        <strong>Success!</strong> <?php echo $this->session->flashdata('success'); ?>
        <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
            <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
        </button>
    </div>
<?php endif; ?>

<?php if ($this->session->flashdata('error')): ?>
    <div class="alert alert-danger alert-dismissible fade show" role="alert">
        <strong>Error!</strong> <?php echo $this->session->flashdata('error'); ?>
        <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
            <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
        </button>
    </div>
<?php endif; ?>
```

Now users will see:
- ✅ **Green success message** when deletion succeeds
- ✅ **Red error message** with details when deletion fails

---

### 3. Enabled Logging (`application/config/config.php`)

Changed line 229:
```php
// Before:
$config['log_threshold'] = 0;  // Logging disabled

// After:
$config['log_threshold'] = 2;  // Debug logging enabled
```

Log file location: `application/logs/log-YYYY-MM-DD.php`

## How to Test

### Test Case 1: Delete DPR with Cutting Tools
1. Go to `http://localhost/dpr/c_dpr/dpr`
2. Find a DPR record that has cutting tools
3. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon)
4. Click **OK** on confirmation
5. **Expected**: 
   - ✅ Page refreshes
   - ✅ **Green success message** appears: "Data berhasil dihapus!"
   - ✅ Record is deleted from table
   - ✅ Log file shows all delete steps

### Test Case 2: Delete DPR without Cutting Tools
1. Find a DPR record without cutting tools
2. Click **Delete** button
3. Click **OK** on confirmation
4. **Expected**:
   - ✅ Success message appears
   - ✅ Record deleted

### Test Case 3: Check Logs
View logs at: `application/logs/log-2025-10-29.php`

Expected log entries:
```
DEBUG - Attempting to delete production: [ID]
DEBUG - Cutting tools usage records found: [N]
DEBUG - Deleted cutting tools usage
DEBUG - Deleted production details
DEBUG - Deleted production op release
DEBUG - Deleted production op - SUCCESS
```

Or if error:
```
ERROR - Delete failed: [error message]
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `application/controllers/c_new.php` - Fixed delete function with logging & error handling
2. ✅ `application/views/dpr/dpr.php` - Added success/error message display
3. ✅ `application/config/config.php` - Enabled debug logging

---

## Important Notes

### Why It Was Failing
The cutting tools feature was added to the DPR system (we saw this in the optimization work), but the delete function was never updated to handle the new `t_production_op_cutting_tools_usage` table. When foreign key constraints exist, you must delete child records before parent records.

### Deletion Order Matters
Always delete in this order:
1. **Cutting tools usage** (child)
2. **Production details** (child)
3. **Production op release** (child)
4. **Production op DL** (child)
5. **Production op** (parent) ← Last!

### Logging
The debug logging will help diagnose any future issues. Once confirmed working, you can reduce log level:
```php
$config['log_threshold'] = 1;  // Only errors (recommended for production)
```

### Error Messages in Indonesian
Current messages:
- Success: "Data berhasil dihapus!" (Data successfully deleted!)
- Error: "Gagal menghapus data: [details]" (Failed to delete data: [details])

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fix**:
   - Try deleting a DPR record with cutting tools
   - Verify success message appears
   - Verify record is actually deleted

2. **Check the logs**:
   - Look at `application/logs/log-2025-10-29.php`
   - Verify debug messages are written
   - Confirm no errors

3. **Report back**:
   - Does it work now?
   - Do you see the success message?
   - Any errors in the log?

4. **After confirmation**:
   - Can reduce log level to 1 (errors only) for production
   - Log files can grow large with debug level

---

## Summary

**Problem**: Delete silently failing due to missing cutting tools usage deletion  
**Root Cause**: Foreign key constraint preventing parent deletion  
**Fix**: Added cutting tools usage deletion + error handling + user feedback + logging  
**Status**: Ready for testing ✅

The delete function should now work properly and provide clear feedback to users!
